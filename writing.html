          <p>What is ambition? The dictionary states ambition as the following "A strong desire to do or to achieve something, typically requiring determination and hard work." In my opinion, there is much more to ambition than the definition describes.
            Ambition isn't simply a desire, it's a need. The need to chase a goal, because no matter what our current situation is like we cannot settle. Ambition is a lifestyle. Striving to do everything with a purpose so that it propels us to our goals.
            Making sacrifices and minimizing aspects of our lives so we can work towards our goals. Ambition is part of who I am. My need to chase a goal is so engraved in who I am, that if you took it away, I honestly don't know who I would be.
            Ambition can be amazing and change your life for the better. However, there are some aspects that can be negative...</p>

          <p>In 2017, I was a junior in college studying Computer Science. Spring semester I was enrolled in Software Engineering, which focused on Android Development.
            We were given projects to choose from. We would work with a team of 3-4 people and an external client for which we were making the application for. We were using the
            Agile software development process split into 3 2-week sprints. After each sprint, we would present a working prototype to our client.
            I worked on this project until May 2018. During this project, I learned how to create a rest API using Node.js, basic MySQL schemas, and intermediate Android
            development. This sparked my interest in Android development and gave me a desire to make an application of my own...</p>

          <p>API handling can be tedious if not completed in a good way. Loading data into an Android app can lag the UI thread if not done on a separate thread. RxJava2 and Retrofit2 are very powerful libraries that solve this problem.
            However, when you first get started with these libraries it can be very difficult to understand how to implement them in your application. I struggled with how to implement them and that is the sole reason I am writing this tutorial...</p>

          <p>Have you ever thought about how to create a splash screen that appears during the launch of your application? Here is a simple way to add a splash screen to your application. First off we need to create an Activity
            for our splash screen. In the onCreate() method we want to create a new Intent() to start the MainActivity after the splash screen is displayed...</p>

          <p>Loading data from a third-party is essential for most Android applications. This data is usually fetched and loaded to the UI upon launching the application. A good way to show the user that data is being
            loaded is with a loading circle overlay on the UI. During this overlay you wouldn't want the user to be able to interact with the UI until the loading has finished. Let's explore one way you can design and
             implement a progress wheel overlay during data loading in your application.</p>
